.TH "saptune-migrate" "7" "March 2019" "" "migration from saptune version 1 to saptune version 2"
.SH NAME
saptune\-migration \- migration of saptune version 1 to saptune version 2

\fBfirst DRAFT\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
As there are too many logical and structural changes between the saptune versions 1 and 2 and as the tuning of a system running SAP workloads is to important to do it wrong or change it during an package update or a system reboot, you need to manually migrate your saptune configuration from version 1 to version 2.

see below the needed steps. And refer to the blog post <add here the link> for more information.

.SH ACTIONS 
The following steps need to perform during a migration from a running and configured saptune version 1 to saptune version 2

.IP \[bu]
check the old, in the future no longer used configuration files \fI/etc/sysconfig/saptune-note-*\fR for customer specific changes

.IP \[bu]
check the new note configuration files in \fB/usr/share/saptune/\fR to see if there is a need to transfer the old customization to the new note definitions and how to do this transition
.IP \[bu]
Create override files for notes in \fB/etc/saptune/override\fR if needed
.IP \[bu]
check for \fI/etc/tuned/saptune/tuned.conf\fR.
.IP \[bu]
check \fB/etc/saptune/extras\fR, if the settings needed any longer
.IP \[bu]
use the command '\fIsaptune note revert <note id>\fR' or '\fIsaptune solution revert <solution name>\fR' to revert all setting properly and to clean the configuration
.IP \[bu]
check and remove all files listed in the section "FILES to remove after the migration"
.IP \[bu]
change saptune version in file \fI/etc/sysconfig/saptune\fR from '1' to '\fB2\fR'
.IP \[bu]
use the command '\fIsaptune solution apply <solution name>\fR' and/or '\fIsaptune note apply <note id>\fR' to get back you tuning for the SAP workload
.IP \[bu]
check again the configuration for left overs

.SH FILES to remove after the migration

The package update from version 1 to version 2 creates or copies some files during post install to allows this smooth migration. But after finishing the migration these files should be removed manually.

.BI /etc/saptune/extra/SAP_BOBJ-SAP_Business_OBJects.conf
.PP
.BI /etc/saptune/extra/SAP_ASE-SAP_Adaptive_Server_Enterprise.conf
.PP
.BI /etc/tuned/saptune/tuned.conf 
and the directory
.BI /etc/tuned/saptune
.PP
.BI /etc/sysconfig/saptune-note-*
