# 2578899 - SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15: Installation Note
# Description:    You want to use SAP software on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 (SLES 15) or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP Applications  (SLES for SAP 15).
# Version 11 from 03.01.2019 in English

[block]
# The default I/O scheduler for SLES is CFQ. It offers satisfactory performance
# for wide range of I/O task, however choosing an alternative scheduler may 
# potentially yield better latency characteristics and throughput. 
# "noop" is an alternative scheduler, in comparison to CFQ it may offer more 
# consistent performance, lower computation overhead, and potentially higher 
# throughput.
# For most SAP environments (RAID, storage arrays, virtualizaton) 'noop' is the
# better choice.
#   
# When set, all block devices on the system will be switched to the chosen 
# scheduler.
IO_SCHEDULER=noop

[sysctl]
# vm.dirty_bytes (indirect vm.dirty_ratio)
# Contains the amount of dirty memory at which a process generating disk writes
# will itself start writeback.
# Note: dirty_bytes is the counterpart of dirty_ratio. Only one of them may be
# specified at a time. When one sysctl is written it is immediately taken into
# account to evaluate the dirty memory limits and the other appears as 0 when
# read.
# Note: when changing the tuned profile or switching off tuned, both values
# will be set back to their previous settings.
# Note: the minimum value allowed for dirty_bytes is two pages (in bytes); any
# value lower than this limit will be ignored and the old configuration will be
# retained.
#
# vm.dirty_bytes should be set to 629145600 (see TID_7010287)
#
vm.dirty_bytes=629145600

# vm.dirty_background_bytes (indirect vm.dirty_background_ratio)
# Contains the amount of dirty memory at which the background kernel
# flusher threads will start writeback.
# Note: dirty_background_bytes is the counterpart of dirty_background_ratio.
# Only one of them may be specified at a time. When one sysctl is written it is
# immediately taken into account to evaluate the dirty memory limits and the
# other appears as 0 when read.
# Note: when changing the tuned profile or switching off tuned, both values
# will be set back to their previous settings.
#
# vm.dirty_background_bytes should be set to 314572800 (see TID_7010287)
#
vm.dirty_background_bytes=314572800
